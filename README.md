* This repository is a project for the MLH HackJaipur Hackathon 2020.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: We used Python script mainly in the project for the entire content.

* **Streamlit**: We used this library for converting our app.py script into a web-app. It uses pure python to convert a simple python script into a fully-interactive web-app.

## Data Source

* We used the **Covid-India** library package, recently launched on PyPi. It is useful for providing the website with live updates of the covid-related statistics.

## Libraries Used

* **Plotly**: The plotly Python library (plotly.py) is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases. Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library, we used this for visual representation of our data.

* **Matplotlib**: Another library used for minimal charts and graphs.

* **Pandas**: A software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

* **BeautifulSoup**: Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.

* **Requests**: Requests was used to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings.
